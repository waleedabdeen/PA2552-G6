The Calculator folder contains a semi-configured Maven Java project with source-files and JUnit test cases to get you started. Note that some configuration may be required to your Maven project for it to work in your environment!

This folder also contains the Project description and the source files for JUnit 4.12.

For support in the project there are multiple videos on ITSLearning.
